      <h3>Site Name</h3>
      <p>
        This site is going to be called TempleInnAndSuits.com. It will be to build a prototype website for a fictitious hotel organization.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Purpose Statement</h3>
      <p>
        Builds and manages specialized hotel accommodations near temple locations of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints worldwide. We want to bring a unique moment in your life, an experience that will leave you with the desire to come back to live it over and over. We want the site to be easy to navigate and straightforward, with the minimum necessary to schedule a day in one of our hotels and very easy to submit payment. Also, the page should use light pastel color for a smooth visible experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The website will be used to obtain weather information as well as locations of multiple Temples and
        promote and provide information about the specialized services that this hotel chain offers to meet
        the needs of temple patrons who come to serve in the temple or who participate in events such as
        sealings, weddings, receptions, and youth trips.

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages
        in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map
        above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page, 4 sub or
        child pages and one of them has 2 child pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should
        be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the
        global navigation for the site.

      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making web pages. They should show the
        major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative
        locations of each element. In the wireframe below you can see there will
        be 6-8 sections on our page:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>At the top, we have a section with the logo and the navigation bar.        </li>
        <li>Then there is a banner image that stretches across the screen.       </li>
        <li>Next, we have some input fields</li>
        <li>then the temple description</li>
        <li>Then one section features and amenities.</li>
        <li>Then one section for the weather.</li>
        <li>Then one section map and directions.</li>
        <li>Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 2 social media icons.
        </li>
      </ol>
