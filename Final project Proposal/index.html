      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making web pages. They should show the
        major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative
        locations of each element. In the wireframe below you can see there will
        be 6-7 sections on our page:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>At the top, we have a section with the logo and the navigation bar.        </li>
        <li>Then there is a banner image that stretches across the screen.       </li>
        <li>Next, we have some input fields</li>
        
        <li>Then one section features and amenities.</li>
        <li>Then one section for the weather.</li>
        <li>Then one section map and directions.</li>
        <li>Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 2 social media icons.
        </li>
      </ol>
